      <p class="whatlearn">Homework #5 will exercise the DOM, browser
        Events and form handling. </p>
      <h4>Add behavior and additional functionality to an HTML <em>FORM</em></h4>
      You'll be adding behavior to the form below, including adding some new
      form fields and sections. You will be adding some of the following
      behaviors and features to the form.&nbsp; Specifically, you must do four
      of the six (your choice) items below. Doing more
      than the minimum counts as extra credit. <br>
      <br>
      You may change the HTML if you like, to make a form that better fits your
      interests or to make the form look better or provide a better user
      experience.&nbsp; But you must make it clear to your grader which of the
      six behaviors you've implemented - this will be especially important if
      you change the form. <br>
      <ol>
        <li>There are two password fields on the form. You will write code that
          ensures that:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Users must enter passwords of at least 8 characters</li>
          <li>The two fields must match</li>
          <li>Users receive feedback immediately if the passwords don't match,
            rather than only when the form is submitted.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>There is a textarea on the form labelled <em>Brief Bio</em>.&nbsp;
          This is going to be <em>really</em> brief.&nbsp; Your code will
          provide a countdown near the <em>140 character limit</em> caption
          that counts backwards from 140 to zero to show users how many
          characters they have left.&nbsp; You may make it so that once the
          limit is reached, no more characters show in the field, even if the
          user keeps typing.&nbsp; Or you may choose to let users keep typing,
          but have the page show users how far over the limit they've gone. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Sometimes a selection in a pull-down menu (an HTML <em>SELECT</em>)
          should populate another SELECT field with complementary values.&nbsp;
          For example, if we're selecting cars, picking Ford in the Make field
          should populate the Model field with Ford models, such as the Focus,
          the Fusion, and the Flex, while picking Dodge might populate the Model
          field with values that include Charger, Challenger, and Caravan.<br>
          <br>
          Your task is to make the two complementary SELECT controls work in
          this way: selecting a value in the first populates the second with
          appropriate choices. The types of values are entirely up to you:
          automobile Make/Model is just an example.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Your form should have at least one subsection which will appear
          depending on the value selected in a checkbox, radio button or SELECT.
          For example, if the user selected a checkbox called "add my Twitter
          account", a section of the form will appear prompting the user for
          their Twitter username.<br>
          <br>
          You may add this feature anywhere on the form.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Phone number: while it's easy to validate a phone number to make
          sure it matches the HTML5 validation pattern, even better is to
          reformat one to make it match. For this field, the user may enter any
          ten-digit number in either xxx-xxx-xxxx, (xxx)xxx-xxxx or xxxxxxxxxx
          form. <br>
          <br>
          Your validation should confirm that it's a ten-digit number,
          regardless of the punctuation used; and format it in the input field
          as xxx-xxx-xxxx.&nbsp; You may do this by applying the formatting live
          (difficult), or waiting until a the user has finished typing in the
          field (onchange or onblur) and then reformat the string (easier) -
          it's up to you.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Upon submitting the form, make sure that at least one of Phone or
          Email are completed.&nbsp; One or the other or both may be filled in,
          but both cannot be blank.&nbsp; Provide a useful message to the user
          if they failed to complete one of these fields.</li>
      </ol>
