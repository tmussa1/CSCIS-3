/* CSCI E-3 Introduction to Web Programming Using Javascript
 * 
 *
 * Homework #1
 *
 * Don't worry if you don't understand all the code in these examples. We're exploring a very specific
 * skill in these examples: using Developer Tools to find and correct errors in your code.
 *
 * By the end of the course you'll be writing stuff like this in your sleep, but for now, just focus on
 * the question at hand: why don't these work as intended?

         *       This function access and manipulates the HTML structure of the Web page
         *        in order to do its business. The manipulations are very simple.
         *
         *        The HTML looks something like this:
         *
         *         <input id="input1" type="number">
         *         <input id="input2" type="number">
         *         <input id="input3" type="number"><br>
         *            <div>Your total is: <span id="resultArea"></span></div>
         *            <div id="clickme2" class="hwbutton">Click Me #2</div>
         *
         *       Don't worry about understanding it all. Just look for a very simple
         *       error in my code for adding three numbers. It's not code that the browser
         *       chokes on - it's syntactically correct and runnable code. It just doesn't do
         *       what I meant to do (add three numbers).
